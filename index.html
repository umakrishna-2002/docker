  <h1>Hello from Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline!</h1>
  <p>
    <h2>let us discuss the process</h2>
    - first create a Dockerfile for the corresponding applications.
    
    - Then create a <b>Jenkins Node</b> & <b>Jenkins Job</b>.
    
    - Add the pipeline script that creates the Docker image everytime we made commits to the application.
    
    - Then add the Dockerhub credintials so, that latest image will be pushed into the central dockerhub everytime.

    - Finally when the commits are made the build is automated, latest image is pulled into DOckerhub and latest application can be accessed.
